Carefully remove the tree from the container keeping the soil around the roots intact. </p> \n <p> 3. Don't yank the tree out of the container as this can separate the roots from the tree. </p> \n <p> 4. If the roots of your tree appear as if they're wrapping around the root ball: </p> \n <p> cut an X across the bottom of the root ball and four vertical slices along the sides of the root ball with a sharp knife. </p> \n <p> 5. Set the tree in the middle of the hole. Avoid planting the tree too deep. </p> \n <p> 6. Using some soil, secure the tree in a straight position, then fill and firmly pack the hole with the original soil. </p> \n <p> 7. Create a water-holding basin around the hole and give the tree a good watering. </p> \n <p> 8. After the water has soaked in, spread protective mulch 2â€“4 inches deep in a 3-foot diameter area around the base of the tree. </p> \n <p> 9. Remove any tags and labels as these will affect the tree as it grows. </p> \n <p> 10. Remember to keep the soil moist but not soggy and to water it more frequently during dry weather. </p> \n <p> 11. Enjoy your tree!</p>"
